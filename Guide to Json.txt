If you're reading this then you are likely interested in modifying the JSON data


heres how the data is structured

{
    "engines": {
        "WhateverEngineName": [
            { "name": "", "quantity": "", "tag": "" }
        ],
	........
    }
}

you need to put the exact name of the part as the script uses exact phrase searches (ie "camshaft (v8)") to ensure the right part is purchased.
the quantity is just a number which represents how many of this part you want (ie "piston with conrod" "8").
and the most complex thing about this is the tag system. the tag is used to say what store you need to go to when buying the part.
no tag means Main Shop, [tuned] means Tuning Shop, [electric] means Electronics Shop, [rim] means Rim Shop, [tire] means Tire Shop, [body tuned] means Body Tuning Shop, [body] means Body Shop, [interior] means Interior Shop, [gearbox] means Custom Gearbox Shop, and [community] means Workshop Body Parts.
its pretty simple really, just make sure you use the correct tag and it should work fine.

now you can make changes to the json file to add new part lists.

(please note that rims and tires cannot be configured and are simply there so every major shop has a tag for navigation) - (feel free to add this functionality if you wish, i personally will not bother doing so. you can reach out to me if you do impliment it and i will put it in the official project if you want)
