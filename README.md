A collection of scripts used to automate the process of buying engines in the game Car Mechanic Simulator 2021


This project is a collection of scripts which is designed to fully automate the process of buying engines. The python script will allow you to change which engine you are working on/buying the parts for, while the AHK script is used for the actual buying of the parts. The JSON file is where data is stored. I will upload a short guide on how the JSON file is structured so you can add new lists if you wanted to buy something other than engines.
You will need AHK 1.1 and Python 3.

Just to note that the script so far only buys the parts required to build the engine on the engine crane, so some engines will be missing parts like exhaust pipes which would be required when installing the engine into a car. This may be worked on at a later date to add the extra parts, but for now it will only be the parts for the crane.

Feel free to modify any part of this to fit your needs. I don't mind this being reuploaded but I would like it if you credited me, and if you are uploading a modified version then feel free to contact me about what you changed and I may impliment it into the official project.

The project is not finished yet, things that still need to be done are actually filling out the engine data which will be done soon. All engines have place holder data at the moment so theres nothing you can actually buy, but you can at least see how the scripts work if you so choose. Even though this project is not finished I'll be uploading the files here and will be listening for any feedback from the community about what I could do to make this better. 



Thanks for taking the time to check out this project. I do have some more plans I would like to do with this but we will see how far it goes.
